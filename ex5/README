ANSWERS:

- 1 -
Linux PID namespaces are used to control what PID's the process inside a container "sees".
So, for example, PID namespaces allow containers to provide functionality such as
suspending the set of processes in the container and moving the container
to a new host while the processes inside the container maintain the same PID's

- 2 -
Linux mount namespaces can be used to isolate the filesystem of the host from the container.
So, mount namespaces mounts a new filesystem inside the container, and by that, the
container has its own filesystem (with a root directory), and it is unaware of the hosts
filesystem.

- 3 -
With cgroups we can control what the container can do. For example:
Limiting the maximal number of processes, usage of memory & CPU, etc.

- 4 -
Clone, similar to Fork, creates a new process by duplicating the calling process.
The new process is referred to as the child process.
The difference between the two are that in Fork, the execution continues from the
point of the parent process. However, with Clone, we get more precise
control over what pieces of execution context are shared between the parent process
and the child process.
In addition, Clone receives a function and arguments as arguments, so the code it
will execute can be different from the parent.

- 5 -
The chroot command changes the root directory of the process and it's child processes

- 6 -
The procfs (proc file system) acts as an interface to internal data structures in the kernel.
It does so by having a hierarchical structure.
It can be used, for example, to obtain information about the system and to change certain kernel parameters
at runtime.
